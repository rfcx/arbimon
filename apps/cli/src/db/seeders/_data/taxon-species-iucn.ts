It has also been recorded in secondary forests (Brooks 2004, Schelsky 2004, Whitworth <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018) and plantations (Whitworth <em>et al.</em>&#160;2018). It feeds on the forest floor, predominantly on berries, fruits and seeds, but will also take nuts and small animals&#160;such as insects, small molluscs and annelids (Cabot 1992, Sick 1997). Breeding is generally between January and July, but perhaps all year round in Suriname where it has been recorded breeding in September. The nest is made between the buttress roots of large trees (del Hoyo <span style="font-style: italic;">et al.</span> 1992).',

In average mantled howlers spend 21% of their time feeding (range 8–40 %, Dias and Negrin 2015). They mainly consume fruits and leaves, but the relative proportions vary by study site, with some populations being mostly folivorous while others have a more equal share of fruits and leaves in their diets. Other food items include flowers, petioles, buds, etc. (see Dias and Negrin 2015 for a detailed review of howler diets).<br/><br/>Group size varies considerably, with some locations reporting sizes of 40 or more individuals in a single group (in Mexico and Costa Rica), although the average group size is 15.2 individuals (Dias and Negrin 2015). Groups include multiple males and females, with a sex ration of 1.79 females per male (Chapman and Balcomb 1998). Group home ranges vary between 8 and 75 ha (see Arroyo-Rodriguez <em>et al.</em> 2015, and references therein).<br/><br/>Mean adult male weight ranges from 5.80 ± 0.69 kg in Mexico (Kelaita <em>et al</em>. 2011), 5.79 ± 0.58 kg in La Pacifica, Costa Rica, 6.57 ± 0.48 kg in Santa Rosa, Costa Rica, and 7.56 ± 0.73 kg in BCI, Panama (Glander 2006), while mean adult female weight ranges from 4.39 ± 0.48 kg in Mexico (Kelaita <em>et al.</em> 2011), 4.73 ± 0.62 kg in La Pacifica, Costa Rica, 5.16 ± 0.54 kg in Santa Rosa, Costa Rica, and 6.45 ± 0.55 kg in BCI, Panama (Glander 2006).<br/><br/>Behavioural and ecological field studies have been carried out mostly in Mexico, Costa Rica, and Panama and at a lesser extent in Nicaragua and Ecuador (see recent reviews in Kowalewski <em>et al.</em> 2015a,b).</p>',

    description: 'It is an arboreal and terrestrial diurnal species of humid lowland and sub-montane forest. It is also found in dense secondary growth and cocoa plantations (Kitasako 1967). The adults are often associated large buttressed trees. Males are essentially non-territorial, but occasionally engage in aggressive competition (Wells 1978). The species is polygynous; females actively compete for males and attempt to guard their mate from others. The species shows a high degree of paternal care. After oviposition upon leaf-litter the male guards and cares for the clutch of three to 13 eggs (Silverstone 1975, Heselhaus 1992). On hatching (13–16 days in captivity) the tadpoles are carried by the male to a stagnant water body in a tree-hole, the leaf axil of a bromeliad (up to 30 m from the forest floor), or a small ground pool (Eaton 1941, van Wijngaarden 1990). Wild tadpoles feed on protozoans and rotifers, and metamorphose after 39–89 days; in captivity, sexual maturity is attained at between six and 15 months (Eaton 1941, Silverstone 1975, Summers 1990, Zimmermann and Zimmermann 1994). A reduction in the number of egg clutches and tadpoles maintained by the male results in a more rapid development of the eggs and higher growth rate of tadpoles (Wells 1978, Summers 1990). Longevity of at least six years has been reported in captivity (Zimmermann and Zimmerman 1994).',

    description: 'Occurs in primary high forest, and seldom found in edge or degraded forest. In Suriname, <em>A. paniscus</em> is almost entirely restricted to high forests in the interior, and, like <em>Chiropotes</em> and <em>Cebus olivaceus</em>, it enters the old coastal plain only in the western part of the country. Although Sanderson (1949) mentioned that <em>Ateles</em> is met with "over certain good areas along a belt 8-15 miles from the coast", this is evidently not the case today. In Guyana, it is also restricted in its habitat, occurring mainly in high forest (Muckenhirn <em>et al</em>. 1975, Sussman and Phillips-Conroy 1995). In Suriname, it rarely enters river edge forest, but Muckenhirn <em>et al.</em> (1975) made several observations of <em>A. paniscus</em> while surveying by canoe along the Berbice River. Van Roosmalen (1980, 1985) argued that this may due to differences in hunting pressure between the areas. To what degree <em>A. paniscus</em> extends to the coastal region of French Guiana is unknown. Kellogg and Goldman (1944) listed three localities for French Guiana: the Camopi River, and two on the coast, Cayenne and the Lunier River. Due to forest destruction and development, the high forest preference of the species, and its susceptibility to hunting, it is reasonable to suppose that if it occurred there in the past it is rare or absent today through large parts at least of the coastal forests. In Brazil, it occurs in lowland, submontane and montane (Serra da Pacaraima) forest.<br/><br/><em>Ateles paniscus</em> is very much a canopy species. Nearly three-quarters of all first sightings of <em>A. paniscus</em> during a three-year field study carried out by Marc van Roosmalen (1980, 1985) in the Voltzberg-Raleighvallen Nature Reserve were of animals in the emergent trees (above 30 m) or upper part of the canopy (25-30 m). They also enter the middle and lower parts of the canopy, but were very rarely seen in the understorey. In accordance with their use of the highest levels of the forest, they are highly suspensory. When travelling they spend more time hanging from branches, moving by brachiation and arm swinging, and climbing than they do walking or running on all fours (Fleagle and Mittermeier 1980). <em>Ateles paniscus</em>, like all spider monkeys, is highly frugivorous and feeds largely on the mature, soft parts of a very wide variety of fruits, which comprise 83% of their diet and are found mainly (77% of its feeding time) in the emergent trees and upper part of the forest canopy (van Roosmalen 1980, 1985; Zhang and Wang 1995a). They also eat young leaves and flowers (both especially at times of fruit shortage during the beginning of the dry season), and besides such as young seeds, floral buds, pseudobulbs, aerial roots, bark, decaying wood, and honey, and very occasionally small insects such as termites and caterpillars. Guillotin <em>et al.</em> (1993) and Simmen and Sabatier (1996) obtained a similar picture for <em>A. paniscus</em> in French Guiana. The pulp of ripe fruits accounted for 85% of their diet. They also recorded the occasional consumption of fungi and mature seeds. Many even quite large fruits are swallowed whole. Swallowing the entire fruit is characteristic of nearly 40% of the fruit species they eat, and in a further 45% of the fruits they bite off the outer layer and swallow the aril or mesocarp along with the seed or seeds.<br/><br/>Due to their specialization on ripe fruits, and the fact that they tend to swallow whole fruits and intact seeds, <em>Ateles</em> are very important seed dispersers for many trees and lianes. Van Roosmalen (1980, 1985; van Roosmalen and Klein 1988) found that <em>A. paniscus</em> was dispersing the seeds of at least 138 species (93.5% of all fruits species used) through their ingestion and subsequent defecation (endozoochory). A further 10 species were being dispersed by the monkeys carrying them off some distance from the tree before dropping them (exozoochory).  In only 23 species were the seeds being ruined or eaten (seed predation).<br/><br/>Spider monkeys live in groups of up to 20-30 individuals (for review see van Roosmalen and Klein 1988). However, they are very rarely all seen together, and nearly always to be found travelling, feeding and resting small in groupings of varying size and composition, the only persistent association being that of a mother and her offspring (McFarland Symington 1990). Group members will also travel on their own. Each female in the group has a “core area” of the group’s home range which she uses most. In Guyana, Muckenhirn <em>et al</em>. (1975) reported an average sub-group size of 2.4 individuals. In Suriname, Van Roosmalen’s (1980, 1985) study group consisted of 18 animals (three adult males, eight adult females, one subadult female, four juveniles and two infants), but the largest subgroup he observed was of nine individuals.<br/><br/>Only van Roosmalen’s (1980, 1985) study has provided an estimate of the home range size for <em>A. paniscus</em>.  His study group covered approximately 255 ha (220 ha with suitable habitat), most of it in high forest and a small portion in high mountain savanna forest. He believes that they maintain discrete, non-overlapping ranges with clearly-defined borders defended by the males, although only a single intergroup encounter was observed at one of these borders. Home range sizes may be bigger in other areas, depending on the distribution and year-round availability of food sources. Within their ranges, subgroups may travel distances from 500 to 5,000 m a day, depending on subgroup size and composition, weather, season, and the distribution of their current food sources (van Roosmalen 1980, 1985). During the dry season, they tend to travel less, especially when leaves have become a more significant component of their diet. Their day typically has two resting periods, one between 08h00 and 10h00 hours, and the other between 12h00 and 14h30. They spend more time resting during the dry season when fruit is scarce. Feeding activity is highest for the first two hours of the morning, and likewise the last two hours before entering their sleeping trees. Van Roosmalen (1980, 1985) recorded 43 different sleeping trees over the three years of his study, but just a few of them were frequently used. They are always tall, emergent trees, well free of the canopy, with a broad, open crown, either small-leaved, leafless or in leaf flush, horizontally branched, and located strategically near the next days feeding site, or better still are the next days feeding site.<br/><br/><em>Ateles</em> are rarely seen in association with other primates and mostly they are occasional and ephemeral, resulting from the simultaneous occupation of fruiting trees. <br/><br/>Although Husson (1957) mentions seeing young animals throughout the year, <em>Ateles</em> have a clearly defined birth season in Suriname. Newborn infants are seen only in November, December and January, indicating that they are born at the end of the long dry season and during the short wet season. However, the few data available from other areas indicate the a lack of a breeding season. Six estimated birth dates given by Klein (1971) for <em>A. belzebuth</em> were spread throughout the year (December, January, April, September, October and November). Spider monkeys apparently reach sexual maturity at 4-5 years of age (Klein 1972; Eisenberg 1973, 1976). They give birth to single offspring after a long gestation period of 226-232 days, with a minimum theoretical interbirth interval in captivity of 17.5 months, but in the wild probably as long as 28-30 months (Eisenberg 1973, 1976). However, for <em>A. paniscus</em>, van Roosmalen (1980) estimated an interbirth interval of 46-50 months for females successfully rearing their young. They show lactational anoestrus for about three years. When in oestrus, females tend to manipulate, inspect and rub their clitoris. Sexual receptivity lasts 8-10 days, with an interestrus of 15-17 days (van Roosmalen 1980). Copulation is generally preceded by much place sniffing and urine licking on the part of the male, who consorts the female during her oestrus, although van Roosmalen (1980) observed that receptive females appeared to choose their mate. It is the receptive female which initiates sexual activity by rushing towards a male and sitting in his lap. If he does not respond she leaves and then returns to repeat the action some minutes later. Behaviour prior to copulation resembles play, involving head-shaking, heavy panting, and even growling and wrestling. Copulation takes place with both monkeys sitting, the male behind the female, grasping the female around her chest and with his legs over and between the females thighs (van Roosmalen 1980). The female copulates three or four times a day during oestrus.<br/><br/>When two individuals meet after a period of separation, they may show a ritualized form of greeting behaviour that includes embracing and pectoral (chest) sniffing (<em>Ateles</em> have olfactory skin glands in this region, but in the wild at least they have never been observed to rub them on branches as has been seen for <em>A. belzebuth</em> for example). Each put their arms around each other and their nose to the others chest which they may lick or sniff. In <em>A. paniscus</em> this may be accompanied by grunting vocalizations, and the embrace is usually initiated by the lower ranking animal of the two (van Roosmalen 1980). It is often followed by genital sniffing. Klein (1971) suggested that the hypertrophied clitoris is for depositing drops of urine as scent marks, and rubbing of the anogenital region also undoubtedly serves in olfactory communication. Communicative tactile signals include also grooming, and wrapping the tail and limbs around other individuals, which often follows embraces. Other behaviours shown in varying contexts, many of them aggressive or agonistic, include head-shaking, chest-scratching, pilo-erection, hopping and bounding, vigorous arm swaying, and branch shaking and dropping, and, when highly aroused, defecation. In agonistic displays the tail may be held up and curled at the tip. Detailed studies of their behaviours and their possible social meanings are described in Eisenberg (1976: see also van Roosmalen and Klein 1988).<br/><br/>Size: <br/>Three males in the British Museum had a mean H&amp;B length of 545 mm (range: 515-580) and a mean TL of 807 mm (range: 720-852); 10 females had a mean H&amp;B length of 540 mm (range: 490-620) and a mean TL of 814 mm (range: 640-930) (Napier 1976). Four females cited in Kellogg and Goldman (1944) had the following measurements: H&amp;B length: 460, 418, 570 and 660; TL 870, 920, 880 and 753. Male <em>A. paniscus</em> are more robust and larger than females. There has been some controversy concerning the possibility that the reverse is true (Ford and Davis 1992, Peres 1994), but a review by Smith (1996) specifically examining this problem points out this supposition was based on statistical error. Body mass for <em>A. paniscus </em> is estimated at 9.11 kg for males and 8.44 kg for females (Mittermeier 1977, Ayres 1986, Smith 1996).',

    commonName: 'Geoffroy’s Spider Monkey',
    description: '<em>Ateles geoffroyi</em> occurs in a variety of habitats throughout Central America, including tall evergreen tropical forest, lowland tropical forest, dry successional deciduous forest, cloud forest, mangrove forest (see Wallace 2008, and references therein). Although they can be found in anthropogenically-disturbed forests, it is suggested that, in general, spider monkeys are highly susceptible to habitat degradation and often fail to persist in smaller forest fragments (Ramos-Fernández and Wallace 2008, and references therein).In general, <em>A. geoffroyi</em> individuals spend a large amount of their time feeding (~33.5-44%), followed by traveling (~32.6-34%), resting (~12-24.1%) and engaged in other activities (~9.8-10%) (Chapman<em> et al</em>. 1989, Chaves <em>et al</em>. 2011). However, they are able to adjust their activity patterns to overcome the effects of food scarcity in forest fragments and seasonality (Chaves <em>et al.</em> 2011).Spider monkey diets are highly biased towards the consumption of fruit, particularly ripe fruits, and for <em>A. geoffroyi</em> the percentage of fruit consumption in their diets has been reported to vary between 55% and 82% (Di Fiore <em>et al</em>. 2008). Other food items include leaves, flowers, invertebrates, etc. and although they obtain water from food items they may also drink water directly from tree holes, bromeliads, streams and other terrestrial water sources (Di Fiore <em>et al</em>. 2008).Spider monkeys live in multi-male/multi-female groups that exhibit a fission–fusion social organization, in which the members of a large stable group separate on a daily basis in small subgroups of changing sizes and composition (Di Fiore <em>et al</em>. 2010). This type of social organization combined with their arboreal habits and fast movements make their observations quite difficult. Only a few studies have been able to quantify the size and composition of <em>A. geoffroyi</em> in the wild, with group sizes varying from 16 to 56 individuals, and a female/male sex ration of 0.8 to to 4.4 (Di Fiore <em>et al</em>. 2010 and references therein). Group home ranges vary greatly between sites from 95 ha in Yucatan, Mexico to 962 ha in Barro Colorado Island, Panama (Wallace 2008).Average weight for adult males is 8.21 kg, ranging from 7.42 to 9 kg, and for females 7.7 kg, ranging from 6 to 9.4 kg (Ford and Davis 1992).Behavioral and ecological field studies have been carried out mostly in Costa Rica and Panama (see recent reviews on different aspects of their behavior in Campbell 2008).',

    commonName: 'Colombian White-throated Capuchin',
    description: 'In Panama, the species occurs in dry deciduous forests on the Pacific coast (rainfall less than 1,75 mm), in mangroves and second growth (Freese and Oppenheimer 1981, Reid 1997). In Colombia, <em>C. capucinus</em> occurs in primary and advanced secondary forest remnants, degraded forests and forests with large concentrations of palms, especially<em> Scheelea magdalenica</em> at altitudes of up to 2,000 m asl (Defler 2004). In Ecuador, it occurs in humid tropical and subtropical forests from sea level to 1,800 m asl (Tirira 2007). <br/><br/>Capuchins are frugivores-insectivores, including a wide variety of fruits, seeds, arthropods, frogs, nestlings and even small mammals in their diet, supplemented by stems, flowers and leaves. They are extractive, manipulative foragers. In a cloud forest in Ecuador (Los Cedros Protected Forest) the species has been reported to be a generalist, inhabiting all types of forest, including grassland with <em>Cecropia</em> trees (Gavilanes-Endara 2007, Estévez-Noboa 2009). It uses mainly the canopy and mid-story level, in trees between 15 and 24 m height (Gavilanes-Endara 2007). Males disperse. Both sexes take up linear hierarchies, the top ranking male being dominant to the top ranking female. Multi-male groups range in size from 5-30 individuals. In Chiriqui, Panama, Baldwin and Baldwin (1977) found <em>C. capucinus</em> occupying small forest patches of 0.2 to 40 ha in small groups of 2-5 individuals, whereas groups in larger forests reached sizes of 20 or more individuals. The home range size for the species averages around 50 to 80 ha (Defler 2004).',

    commonName: 'Geoffroy’s Tamarin',
    description: 'The species occurs in moist seasonal dry forests and secondary forests and scrub (Moynihan 1970; Dawson 1976; Skinner 1985; Garber 1993).<br/><br/>Marmosets and tamarins are distinguished from the other monkeys of the New World by their small size, modified claws rather than nails on all digits except the big toe, the presence of two as opposed to three molar teeth in either side of each jaw, and by the occurrence of twin births. They eat fruits, flowers, nectar, plant exudates (gums, saps, latex) and animal prey (including frogs, snails, lizards, spiders and insects). Marmosets have morphological and behavioural adaptations for gouging tree trunks, branches and vines of certain species to stimulate the flow of gum, which they eat, and in some species form a notable component of the diet. The dentition of the tamarins (<em>Saguinus </em>and <em>Leontopithecus</em>) does not provide for gouging and they eat gums only when readily available. <br/><br/>Tamarins live in extended family groups of between two and 15 individuals, but usually 2-8 individuals. Average group size recorded for <em>Saguinus geoffroyi</em> by Dawson (1977) was 5-7 individuals (range 3-9 individuals). Diaz-Muñoz (2010) studied three groups of two, six and nine individuals in Gamboa, Panama. Generally, only one female per group breeds. Home ranges vary from 9.4 ha (Garber 1980a,b) to 32 ha (Dawson 1979; Diaz-Muñoz 2010) ), depending evidently on seasonal resource distribution and abundance.<br/><br/>There have been a number of ecological and behavioural studies of the species in Panama—first studied by Moynihan (1970) and Hladik and Hladik (1969) on the Island of Barro Colorado, then by Dawson (1976, 1977, 1979; Dawson and Dukelow 1976) and subsequently by Garber (1980a, b, 1984), both at the Rodman Naval Station, near Balboa. Further studies followed by Lindsay (1980) at Punta Escoces, San Blas, and by Skinner (1985, 1986) who carried out surveys at 30 sites in Panama. New data have been collected for the Fundación Pro-Conservación de los Primates Panameños (FCPP), regarding actual distribution and population of the species as a part of a conservation plan monitoring of non-human primates under scientific permission SE/A-70-12-16). <br/>Infants are born throughout the year, but <em>S. geoffroyi</em> shows a peak of births between April and June (Dawson and Dukelow 1976). Oestrous cycles average 15.5 days. Gestation unknown, but probably similar to <em>S. oedipus</em> at about 145 days. Inter-birth intervals range from 154 to 540 days (average 311 days; Skinner 1986).<br/><strong><br/>Size</strong>:<br/>Mean adult male body weight 486 g (n = 53).',
