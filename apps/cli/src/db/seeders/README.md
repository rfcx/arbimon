# Seeders

Seeders are only executed on the latest schema.

If you update the schema via a migration, and you want to continue using a related seeder, you need to update the seeder.

There is no reason to keep historical versions of seeders.

## Local

Seeders in `auto` will be automatically run as part of `serve`. You can also run them manually:

   `pnpm serve lib/db/seed -- --path=auto`
   OR
   `pnpm db-seed`

Seeders in `optional` can be individually run using:

   `pnpm serve lib/db/seed -- --path=optional/name-of-seeder.ts`

## Testing/Staging

You can run any seeder in `auto` or `optional` on `testing`/`staging` using:

   `TODO`

## Production

**Do not commit production data/seeders.**

You can run seeders in `production` using the same process as `testing`/`staging`.
