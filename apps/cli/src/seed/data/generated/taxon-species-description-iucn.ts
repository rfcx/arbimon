    description: 'The Yellow-shouldered Blackbird occupies a variety of habitats, all typically along the coast where it is most common (Jaramillo and Burke 1999). Such habitats include: mud flats, salt flats, offshore red mangroves&#160;(<em>Rhizophora mangle</em>) cays, black mangrove (<em>Avicennia germinans</em>) forests, lowland dry coastal pastures, suburban areas (including buildings), coconut (<em>Cocos nucifera</em>) plantations, and coastal cliffs (Skutch 1996, Lewis <em>et al</em>. 1999, Falcon <em>et al</em>. 2000, USFWS 2018).&#160;The species was once common in coastal forests, however during the early 20th century, the majority of Puerto Rico\'s coastal forests were replaced by sugar cane plantations, and latterly housing or livestock pasture (USFWS 2011, 2018, J.&#160;Martínez <em>in litt</em>. 2020). Many birds now breed on offshore cays (Skutch 1996)<strong></strong>. Whilst non-migratory, some individuals of the main island population are known to move inland to inhabit subtropical wet forest during the non-breeding season to forage (USFWS 2011). Whilst typically an arboreal insectivore, the species also forages terrestrially, consuming arachnids, small molluscs, fruits, seeds and nectar from various plant species (Skutch 1996,&#160;Raffaele <em>et al</em>. 1998, Jaramillo and Burke 1999, USFWS 2011); it has also been evidenced to consume exposed or discarded human food and livestock feed (USFWS 2018). Birds gather at communal feeding-sites, with large flocks forming during the non-breeding season (Jaramillo and Burke 1999)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Nests are often built low in mangrove trees, or in large deciduous trees in pastures near to mangroves (Skutch 1996)<strong></strong>, with several nests being built in close proximity (Jaramillo and Burke 1999)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. On Mona Island, nests are placed in crevices or on ledges on high, vertical sea-cliffs (Skutch 1996)<strong></strong>. Three clutches are usually laid per year (Skutch 1996)<strong></strong>, and the breeding season is May-September.<p></p>'

    description: 'The species inhabits lush areas in arid lowlands and foothills, especially gallery forest, deciduous woodland and dry, open pine-oak woodland on ridges up to 1,000 m. In central Tamaulipas it has been observed in mixed landscapes of wooded mountain slopes with adjacent mixed scrub, citrus or villages (T. Brush <em>in litt. </em>2016). Smaller numbers occur in agricultural landscapes with a few large trees. Nests are usually in tree-cavities, with breeding from March-May. Clutches of 2-5 eggs are incubated for 25-31 days (Enkerlin-Hoeflich and Hogan 1997)<strong><sup></sup></strong>. It is nomadic in winter, with large flocks moving south (and apparently north) and to higher elevations.

It is presently more abundant in closed canopy dry forest on limestone soils, composed mainly of semi-deciduous hardwood trees with abundant leaf litter and an open understorey (little or no ground vegetation) at elevations up to 620 m asl, but more commonly above 75 m asl. It occurs at lower densities in dry, open, scrubby secondary growth, xeric or dry scrubland, open scrub-forest and thorny forest undergrowth, with a few birds in <em>Eucalyptus robusta</em> plantations (Cleere and Nurney 1998)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Breeding occurs between late February and early July, mainly between April and June (Vilella 1995)<strong></strong>. Nests are common at elevations above 100 m asl and are characterised by a deep layer of leaf litter and an open midstorey beneath a closed canopy (Vilella 2008)<strong></strong>. Birds are perhaps permanently territorial, exhibiting strong interannual site fidelity<strong></strong>. In Guánica forest, <em>c.</em> 87% of nests in one year produced at least one fledgling (Vilella 1995)<strong></strong>.

    description: '<strong>Behaviour</strong> Most populations of this species are partially migratory, making long-distance dispersive movements related to food resources in connection with seasonal rainfall (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Other populations (e.g. in north-east Asia and North America) are fully migratory (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). The species breeds throughout the year in the tropics with different regional peaks (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) depending on food availability (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It breeds colonially, often with other species, in groups that number from a few dozen to several thousand pairs, even up to 10,000 pairs in Africa (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). The nesting effort of the species is related to rainfall patterns, leading to an annual variation in productivity (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Outside of the breeding season the species remains gregarious (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), feeding in loose flocks of 10-20 individuals (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982) and often gathering in flocks of hundreds or even thousands of individuals where food is abundant (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Nocturnal roosting sites in Africa commonly hold a few hundred to 2,000 individuals (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). The species is a diurnal feeder (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and commonly associates with native grazing mammals or domesticated livestock (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and may follow farm machinery to capture disturbed prey (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Habitat</strong> The species inhabits open grassy areas such as meadows (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), livestock pastures (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), semi-arid steppe (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and open savanna grassland subject to seasonal inundation (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), dry arable fields (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), artificial grassland sites (e.g. lawns, parks, road margins and sports fields) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), flood-plains (Hancock and Kushlan 1984), freshwater swamps, rice-fields, wet pastures (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), shallow marshes (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), mangroves (Hancock and Kushlan 1984) and irrigated grasslands (with ponds, small impoundments, wells, canals, small rivers and streams) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It rarely occupies marine habitats or forested areas (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) although in Australia it may enter woodlands and forests, and it shows a preference for freshwater (Marchant and Higgins 1990) although it may also use brackish or saline habitats (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It occurs from sea-level up to c.1,500 m (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) or locally up to c.4,000 m (Peru) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists primarily of insects such as locusts, grasshoppers (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), beetles, adult and larval Lepidoptera, Hemiptera, dragonflies (Hancock and Kushlan 1984) and centipedes but worms (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982), spiders (Hancock and Kushlan 1984), crustaceans, frogs, tadpoles, molluscs, fish, lizards, small birds, rodents and vegetable matter (e.g. palm-nut pulp) may also be taken (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is constructed of twigs and vegetation (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and is positioned up to 20 m high in reedbeds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005), marshes, mangroves, dense thickets (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), bushes or trees (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005), usually over or surrounded by water (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species nests colonially in single- or mixed-species groups with the nests placed close or touching (Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Management information</strong> The species can adversely affect the trees and bushes it uses for nesting, which may lead to the abandonment of the colony site if it is not managed (Kushlan and Hancock 2005).'

    description: '<p>The wild goat inhabits mountainous areas, where there is a mixture of rocky outcrops (including scree slopes) and vegetation (shrubby thickets (maquis) or conifer forests). It is a mixed forest species in the Caucasus, especially in the Greater Caucasus (Magomedov et al. 2014; Weinberg 1999), though it usually inhabits relatively arid habitats in most of its range and may depend upon water sources there (Korshunov 1994, Morovati <em>et al</em>. 2014, Shams <em>et al</em>. 2010). Choice of topography, steepness and exposure of the slopes depend upon season, threats and peculiarities of climate and vegetation, but all sources underline principal importance of ruggedness and steepness of slopes at all elevations (Korshunov 1986; Magomedov <em>et al</em>. 2014; Shams <em>et al</em>. 2010; Weinberg 1999). However, in the Greater Caucasus, males tend to choose higher elevations than females outside the rut (Magomedov <em>et al.</em> 2014; Weinberg 1999). South slopes are avoided only in summer and preferred in winter and spring, even in Iran (Shams <em>et al</em>. 2010). In general, distinctive seasonal migrations are not typical for the animals in the Caucasus, except maybe males who can dwell rather far away from females outside the rut in the Caucasus Minor (Magomedov <em>et al. </em>2014; Weinberg 1999; Weinberg and Malkhasyan 2011, 2017). <br/><br/>It is herbivorous, feeding on grasses, herbaceous plants and shrubs, and can climb not very tall trees like junipers and oaks and certainly surpass tur in this respect (Weinberg 1984, 1999). Diet varies geographically and seasonally, being greatly affected by precipitation and availability of green vegetation. In Turkmenistan, grasses and herbs dominate in the spring diet, but later significance of maple <em>Acer turcomanicum</em> increases and in winter juniper may dominate (Korshunov 1994).<br/><br/>In Turkmenistan, females reach maturity at the age of one year (more precisely 1.5 year) but most females mate only at the age of 2 years (Korshunov 1994), while in Daghestan most of yearling females mate (Magomedov <em>et al.</em> 2014). Yearling males may court females during the rut and at two-year age almost invariably leave female groups (Weinberg and Malkhasyan 2011). Rut lasts from early November to mid-December in Turkmenistan (Korshunov 1994), from mid-November to the second decade of December in Daghestan in the Greater Caucasus and is some two weeks late compared to that of sympatric tur (Magomedov <em>et al. </em>2014, Weinberg 1999). First newborns have been observed in the beginning of June there (Magomedov et al. 2014). However, due to huge species range, reproductive periods vary in different areas. Thus in Karchat Mountains in southern Pakistan, rut may take place, in different years, from August until mid-October, and newborns appear from mid-January to April.&#160; Such variations in timing may depend upon precipitation influencing nutritional condition of the animals, primarily females (Edge and Olson-Edge 1990; Schaller 1977). Fecundity is high, twinning being frequent and triplets have been observed all over the range (Gunoglu and Ogurlu 2009, Magomedov <em>et al.</em> 2014, Roberts 1977, Weinberg and Malkhasyan 2011). Post-parturition period kid/female index varies from 0.46 in Pakistan (Edge and Olson-Edge 1990) to 0.5 in Turkmenistan (Korshunov 1994), to 1.0 in Armenia (Weinberg and Malkhasyan 2011) and to 1.26 in one year in Daghestan (Magomedov <em>et al. </em>2014). Yearlings make 9.8% to17.1% during the rut in different areas in Armenia (Weinberg and Malkhasyan 2011), and 16-18% in Daghestan (Magomedov <em>et al.</em> 2014), but probably the lower figure is more typical to the rest of the species range.<br/><br/>Wild goat is a principal prey for leopard <em>Panthera pardus</em> in Iran (Farhadinia <em>et al</em>. 2018) but also an important prey for Cheetah <em>Acinonyx jubatus</em> in central Iran (Farhadinia and Hemami 2010), while wolf <em>Canis lupus</em> rarely hunts wild goat in Iran (Hosseini-Zavarei <em>et al.</em> 2013). In the Greater Caucasus, impact of predators upon wild goat is generally considered non-significant (Magomadov <em>et al.</em> 2014, Weinberg 1999), though Eurasian lynx <em>Lynx lynx</em>, wolf and even brown bear <em>Ursus arctos</em> can catch, at least, juveniles (Weinberg, 2013) and golden eagles <em>Aquila chrysaetos</em> scan cliffs intermittently in summer and try to hunt kids (Weinberg 1999). Mortality caused by snow avalanches has not been recorded, even in the Greater Caucasus, unlike tur <em>Capra caucasica</em> and <em>Capra cylindricornis</em>&#160; (Magomedov <em>et al</em>. 2014). In Daghestan in the North Greater Caucasus, females may live up to 18 years but usually less, while males can reach the age of 14 (Magomedov <em>et al</em>. 2014). In Turkmenistan, males live up to 11 years (Korshunov 1994). Mortality among juveniles varies from 40% to 75% in different areas and years in Armenia (Weinberg and Malkhasyan 2011). In Daghestan, this index is about 35%, while among adults it is about 3-6%, higher in males (Magomedov <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>In the Greater Caucasus in Daghestan and Chechnya, wild goat is sympatric with the Eastern tur <em>Capra cylindricornis</em> that dominates above timberline but may be less numerous than wild goat in the forest (Weinberg 1999). In Chechnya, wild goat is sympatric, but much less numerous, with Caucasian chamois <em>Rupicapra r. caucasica</em>, particularly on the limestone Rocky Range (Lukarevsky 2018). However, main wild goat distribution on the northern slope of the Eastern Greater Caucasus is on the Side Range, where chamois is very rare (Weinberg 1999). Where wild goat does occur on the north slope of the Main Range, it is a forest dweller as usual in the Greater Caucasus, while chamois mostly stays above timberline (Babaev <em>et al</em>. 2016). Roe deer <em>Capreolus capreolus</em> also shares habitat with the wild goat, not only in the Greater Caucasus (Weinberg 1999), but also in several locations in South-East Armenia (Weinberg, 2011). In the Caucasus Minor and the rest of the vast range, it often is sympatric with various wild sheep: mouflon <em>Ovis gmelini, </em>urial <em>Ovis vignei</em> etc. (sheep preferring less precipitous terrain). Thus, though being sympatric with several other ungulate species, wild goat is usually ecologically more or less separated from them.</p>'

    description: '<strong>Behaviour </strong>This species is predominantly sedentary or locally dispersive, but makes partially or fully migratory movements in the northern parts of its range due to its vulnerability to freezing conditions (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). Most northern populations move south from September to December, returning again from March to May (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). The species breeds in solitary territorial pairs during the spring, especially during wet months (the exact timing varying geographically) (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). It remains largely solitary throughout the year although juveniles and adults may form diurnal feeding groups of up to 30 individuals in the winter, especially during hard weather (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), often congregating on sheltered lakes and ponds (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). <strong><br/><br/>Habitat </strong>The species inhabits freshwater wetlands, both still and moving, requiring easy access to open water (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996) and showing a preference for waters sheltered by woodland, bushes or tall emergent vegetation (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998). Suitable habitats include slow-flowing rivers (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998), oxbow lakes (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), streams, canals, ditches, lakes, reservoirs, sites with small open water surfaces such as pools and ponds only a few metres across, swamps, marshes (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998), seasonally flooded sites (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996) such as flood-plains (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), disused gravel pits, rice-fields (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998), sewage ponds (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), and occasionally mangroves (Puerto Rico)<strong></strong>.

When foraging the species may range onto drier grassland, agricultural land or meadows, and on migration and in the winter months it can often be observed on damp grassland away from water (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). <strong><br/><br/>Diet </strong>The species is omnivorous and opportunistic, its diet consisting of earthworms, crustaceans, molluscs, adult and larval insects (especially flies, mayflies, caddisflies, bugs, beetles and Lepidoptera), spiders, small fish, tadpoles and occasionally birds eggs, as well as plant matter such as filamentous algae, moss, the vegetative parts of reeds and aquatic plants, the seeds of reeds, rushes, sedges, water-lilies, waterside herbaceous vegetation, trees (<em>Ulmus</em> spp.) and cereal crops, flowers of <em>Eichhornia</em> spp., and the berries and fruits of yew, <em>Rubus</em>, <em>Sorbus</em>, <em>Rosa</em>, <em>Crataegus</em>, <em>Rhamnus</em>, <em>Hedera</em>, <em>Sambucus</em>, <em>Hippophae</em> spp. and various orchard trees (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). <strong><br/><br/>Breeding site </strong>The nest varies between a shallow saucer and a deep cup constructed from twigs and waterside vegetation, and can be floating on or positioned up to 1 m above water in emergent vegetation, or positioned on a solid platform of branches in water. Less often the nest is placed in ground vegetation or in low bushes on the bank near water, or in bushes and trees up to 8 m from the ground (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). <strong><br/><br/>Management information </strong>Early harvesting in rice-fields should be avoided as it harms nests and young broods of this species (Taylor and van Perlo 1998).'

    description: 'This species is often associated with man, living around buildings from  isolated farms to urban centres and showing a preference for suburbs. In  the south of its range it is more frequently found in open country, and  has been recorded as breeding in small isolated colonies away from  humans. In Central Asia and Afghanistan, the species is mainly a summer visitor, where it is confined to open country in the area of overlap with resident <em>P. montanus</em>; farther north, in Siberia, the two species live side by  side in built-up areas. It breeds from February to September, although timing varies  with latitude. It breeds in loose colonies and nests are constructed  mainly of plant stems, lined with feathers or other soft material. Its  preferred site is a hole in a building, cliff or tree. Clutches are two  to five eggs. The diet is mainly vegetable material, particularly seeds  of grasses, cultivated cereals and low herbs, but also buds, berries and  wide range of household scraps. It does take some animal matter (c. 10%  of the diet in summer months). The species is mostly resident with some limited withdrawal of populations breeding at high latitudes and altitudes to less cold areas in winter  (Summers-Smith <em>et al</em>. 2015).'

    description: 'A nocturnal and terrestrial toad that inhabits humid areas with adequate cover, including cane fields, savannah, open forest, well watered yards and gardens. It also inhabits dry equatorial forests. It thrives in degraded habitats and man-made environments, and is occasionally found in pristine lowland and montane rainforests, but generally prefers open or disturbed habitat such as tracks, roads, low grassland and areas that are near human settlement, e.g. grazing land, suburban parks and gardens. It tends to avoid more densely vegetated areas (eg. wet sclerophyll and rainforest), which can then act as a barrier to their dispersal. It can be found by day beneath fallen trees, loose boards, matted coconut leaves, and similar cover (Lynn 1940). It feeds on arthropods (especially ants and termites) and small vertebrates. It is flexible regards breeding site (Evans <em>et al.</em> 1996); eggs and larvae develop in slow or still shallow waters of ponds, ditches, temporary pools, reservoirs, canals, and streams. Clutch size is between 8,000 and 17,000. Eggs and tadpoles are poisonous and displace native tadpoles. It may sometimes breed in slightly brackish water in Hawaii. Larvae are tolerant of high temperatures.'
