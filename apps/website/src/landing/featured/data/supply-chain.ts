      'This study will support sustainable agricultural systems by comparing biodiversity levels in primary forests, restoration sites, oil palm plantations, and invasive eucalyptus trees. Acoustic recorders were deployed at 52 sites in the Sabah region of Borneo, and recordings were analyzed using Arbimon.',
      'Overall, the integration of soundscape and multi-species occupancy model analyses has yielded valuable insights into the factors shaping biodiversity across different land cover types, while also revealing potential strategies for enhancing biodiversity in degraded areas. One of the most exciting findings of the study is the comparable species richness and bird composition observed in primary forest to that in the restoration area facilitated by the Sow-A-Seed project, which utilized an enrichment line-planting technique over a span of approximately 20 years. In addition, our results suggest that sites in primary forests and restoration areas have significantly higher bird richness compared to sites in eucalyptus and oil palm plantations. On average, primary forests showed more than 2.5 times the bird richness of eucalyptus plantations and approximately 3 times the bird richness of oil palm plantations. These outcomes suggest that such a restoration approach holds promise as an effective strategy for enhancing bird diversity in heavily degraded regions of Borneo.  Additionally, the study demonstrates similar soundscape compositions between forest and restoration areas, further distinguishing them from oil palm and eucalyptus plantations.'

By working closely with local communities, they are able to create value for the ecosystems, including the people calling them home. These results will be used to prioritize highest-value land management approaches and arm Ecoculture with the data required to measure impact across their projects. It was found that soundscapes from primary forest and restoration sites are similar, suggesting that restoration sites are able to maintain high biodiversity levels. Therefore, it is important to continue forward with these high-value projects.'
