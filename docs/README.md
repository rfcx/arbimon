## Installation

### _One-Time Setup_

1. Install tools:

   - node 16: [https://nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org)
   - pnpm 6: `npm i -g pnpm`
   - VSCode & extensions: `pnpm init-vscode` (requires [`code` command in path](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line))
   - If you have Vetur installed, disable it for this workspace

2. Install/update dependencies:

   `pnpm i`

3. Setup local environment:
   - Copy `apps/api/.env.example` to `.env` (and fill missing variables)
   - Copy `apps/website/.env` to `.env.local` (and fill missing variables)

## Run the App!

1. Start **Website** and **API** in dev-mode:

   `pnpm serve` (from the monorepo root)  
   _or_  
   `pnpm -w serve` (from anywhere in the project)

## More Commands

### _Build, Lint, Test_

- Use the pnpm arg `-r` to run scripts in all packages:

  `pnpm -r build`  
  `pnpm -r lint`  
  `pnpm -r test`

- You can run all lint auto-fixes with:

  `pnpm -r lint-fix`

### _Resetting Workspace_

- Delete all build artifacts:

  `pnpm -r clean`

- Delete all build artifacts AND dependencies (node_modules):

  `pnpm -w clean-slate` (usually followed by `pnpm i` to reinstall a fresh copy)

### _Cheatsheet: pnpm_

- `pnpm -w blah` => run in monorepo-root
- `pnpm -r blah` => run in all packages
- `pnpm --filter=!rfcx-bio blah` => run in all packages, except root  
  (or `pnpm --filter=\!rfcx-bio blah` in zsh)
- `pnpm -r --filter=./apps blah` => run in some packages
- `pnpm --filter=website blah` => run in one package

## Deployment

There are 3 shared deployments:

- testing: for the DT to test features when deployed & collaborate
  - https://testing-ba.rfcx.org
  - https://testing-ba-api.rfcx.org
- staging: for stakeholders to review & give early feedback
  - https://staging-ba.rfcx.org
  - https://staging-ba-api.rfcx.org
- production: real public project
  - https://ba.rfcx.org
  - https://ba-api.rfcx.org

### _Testing_

// TODO: Auto-deploy from `develop` branch once per day?

Any branch can be deployed to the `testing` cluster:

- Open the "Actions" tab on GitHub
- Select the "Build-Deploy" action
- Click "Run workflow" and select the branch you wish to deploy

### _Staging & Production_

`staging` & `production` are automatically deployed by GitHub Actions (CD):

- every push to `staging` branch => `staging` deploy
- every push to `master` branch => `production` deploy

## Environment (Config & Secrets)

### _Local Environment_

// TODO: Standardize this; I like that `website` is ready to go on fresh clones...

- Developers can set the values of configuration and secrets locally using:
  - `/apps/api/.env` (copy `.env.example` to get started)
  - `/apps/website/.env.local` (override any variable in `.env`)

### _Deployed Environment_

- _Config_ variables are committed to Git:
  - `/tools/deployment/api/<NAMESPACE>/config.yaml`
  - `/apps/website/.env`
- _Secret_ variables must be manually configured:
  - API secrets can be set manually via Kubernetes apply
  - Website secrets can be set manually as GitHub secrets
  - // TODO: run Kubernetes apply from CD
  - **The values of secrets should never be committed to Git**
