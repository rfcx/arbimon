Many birds now breed on offshore cays (Skutch 1996)<strong></strong>. Whilst non-migratory, some individuals of the main island population are known to move inland to inhabit subtropical wet forest during the non-breeding season to forage (USFWS 2011). Whilst typically an arboreal insectivore, the species also forages terrestrially, consuming arachnids, small molluscs, fruits, seeds and nectar from various plant species (Skutch 1996,&#160;Raffaele <em>et al</em>. 1998, Jaramillo and Burke 1999, USFWS 2011); it has also been evidenced to consume exposed or discarded human food and livestock feed (USFWS 2018). Birds gather at communal feeding-sites, with large flocks forming during the non-breeding season (Jaramillo and Burke 1999)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. Nests are often built low in mangrove trees, or in large deciduous trees in pastures near to mangroves (Skutch 1996)<strong></strong>, with several nests being built in close proximity (Jaramillo and Burke 1999)<strong></strong><strong></strong>. On Mona Island, nests are placed in crevices or on ledges on high, vertical sea-cliffs (Skutch 1996)<strong></strong>. Three clutches are usually laid per year (Skutch 1996)<strong></strong>, and the breeding season is May-September.<p></p>",

        description: '<strong>Behaviour</strong> Most populations of this species are partially migratory, making long-distance dispersive movements related to food resources in connection with seasonal rainfall (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Other populations (e.g. in north-east Asia and North America) are fully migratory (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Snow and Perrins 1998). The species breeds throughout the year in the tropics with different regional peaks (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) depending on food availability (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It breeds colonially, often with other species, in groups that number from a few dozen to several thousand pairs, even up to 10,000 pairs in Africa (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). The nesting effort of the species is related to rainfall patterns, leading to an annual variation in productivity (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). Outside of the breeding season the species remains gregarious (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), feeding in loose flocks of 10-20 individuals (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982) and often gathering in flocks of hundreds or even thousands of individuals where food is abundant (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). Nocturnal roosting sites in Africa commonly hold a few hundred to 2,000 individuals (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982). The species is a diurnal feeder (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and commonly associates with native grazing mammals or domesticated livestock (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and may follow farm machinery to capture disturbed prey (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Habitat</strong> The species inhabits open grassy areas such as meadows (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), livestock pastures (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), semi-arid steppe (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) and open savanna grassland subject to seasonal inundation (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), dry arable fields (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), artificial grassland sites (e.g. lawns, parks, road margins and sports fields) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), flood-plains (Hancock and Kushlan 1984), freshwater swamps, rice-fields, wet pastures (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), shallow marshes (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), mangroves (Hancock and Kushlan 1984) and irrigated grasslands (with ponds, small impoundments, wells, canals, small rivers and streams) (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It rarely occupies marine habitats or forested areas (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992) although in Australia it may enter woodlands and forests, and it shows a preference for freshwater (Marchant and Higgins 1990) although it may also use brackish or saline habitats (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). It occurs from sea-level up to c.1,500 m (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) or locally up to c.4,000 m (Peru) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists primarily of insects such as locusts, grasshoppers (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992), beetles, adult and larval Lepidoptera, Hemiptera, dragonflies (Hancock and Kushlan 1984) and centipedes but worms (Brown <em>et al.</em> 1982), spiders (Hancock and Kushlan 1984), crustaceans, frogs, tadpoles, molluscs, fish, lizards, small birds, rodents and vegetable matter (e.g. palm-nut pulp) may also be taken (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992). <strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is constructed of twigs and vegetation (Kushlan and Hancock 2005) and is positioned up to 20 m high in reedbeds (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005), marshes, mangroves, dense thickets (Kushlan and Hancock 2005), bushes or trees (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1992, Kushlan and Hancock 2005), usually over or surrounded by water (Kushlan and Hancock 2005). The species nests colonially in single- or mixed-species groups with the nests placed close or touching (Snow and Perrins 1998). <strong>Management information</strong> The species can adversely affect the trees and bushes it uses for nesting, which may lead to the abandonment of the colony site if it is not managed (Kushlan and Hancock 2005).',

It is one of the most common members within the genus of Buteo in North America or worldwide. The red-tailed hawk is one of three species colloquially known in the United States as the "chickenhawk", though it rarely preys on standard-sized chickens. The bird is sometimes also referred to as the red-tail for short, when the meaning is clear in context. Red-tailed hawks can acclimate to all the biomes within their range, occurring on the edges of non-ideal habitats such as dense forests and sandy deserts. The red-tailed hawk occupies a wide range of habitats and altitudes, including deserts, grasslands, coniferous and deciduous forests, agricultural fields, and urban areas. Its latitudinal limits fall around the tree line in the subarctic and the species is absent from the high Arctic. Generally it favors varied habitats with open woodland, woodland edge and open terrain. It is legally protected in Canada, Mexico, and the United States by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.',

Other subspecies are all-year residents on Caribbean islands. As in most raptors, females are slightly larger than males. Broad-winged hawks' wings are relatively short and broad with a tapered, somewhat pointed appearance. The two types of coloration are a dark morph with fewer white areas and a light morph that is more pale overall. Although the broad-winged hawk's numbers are relatively stable, populations are declining in some parts of its breeding range because of forest fragmentation.",

        description: '<p>The wild goat inhabits mountainous areas, where there is a mixture of rocky outcrops (including scree slopes) and vegetation (shrubby thickets (maquis) or conifer forests). It is a mixed forest species in the Caucasus, especially in the Greater Caucasus (Magomedov et al. 2014; Weinberg 1999), though it usually inhabits relatively arid habitats in most of its range and may depend upon water sources there (Korshunov 1994, Morovati <em>et al</em>. 2014, Shams <em>et al</em>. 2010). Choice of topography, steepness and exposure of the slopes depend upon season, threats and peculiarities of climate and vegetation, but all sources underline principal importance of ruggedness and steepness of slopes at all elevations (Korshunov 1986; Magomedov <em>et al</em>. 2014; Shams <em>et al</em>. 2010; Weinberg 1999). However, in the Greater Caucasus, males tend to choose higher elevations than females outside the rut (Magomedov <em>et al.</em> 2014; Weinberg 1999). South slopes are avoided only in summer and preferred in winter and spring, even in Iran (Shams <em>et al</em>. 2010). In general, distinctive seasonal migrations are not typical for the animals in the Caucasus, except maybe males who can dwell rather far away from females outside the rut in the Caucasus Minor (Magomedov <em>et al. </em>2014; Weinberg 1999; Weinberg and Malkhasyan 2011, 2017). <br/><br/>It is herbivorous, feeding on grasses, herbaceous plants and shrubs, and can climb not very tall trees like junipers and oaks and certainly surpass tur in this respect (Weinberg 1984, 1999). Diet varies geographically and seasonally, being greatly affected by precipitation and availability of green vegetation. In Turkmenistan, grasses and herbs dominate in the spring diet, but later significance of maple <em>Acer turcomanicum</em> increases and in winter juniper may dominate (Korshunov 1994).<br/><br/>In Turkmenistan, females reach maturity at the age of one year (more precisely 1.5 year) but most females mate only at the age of 2 years (Korshunov 1994), while in Daghestan most of yearling females mate (Magomedov <em>et al.</em> 2014). Yearling males may court females during the rut and at two-year age almost invariably leave female groups (Weinberg and Malkhasyan 2011). Rut lasts from early November to mid-December in Turkmenistan (Korshunov 1994), from mid-November to the second decade of December in Daghestan in the Greater Caucasus and is some two weeks late compared to that of sympatric tur (Magomedov <em>et al. </em>2014, Weinberg 1999). First newborns have been observed in the beginning of June there (Magomedov et al. 2014). However, due to huge species range, reproductive periods vary in different areas. Thus in Karchat Mountains in southern Pakistan, rut may take place, in different years, from August until mid-October, and newborns appear from mid-January to April.&#160; Such variations in timing may depend upon precipitation influencing nutritional condition of the animals, primarily females (Edge and Olson-Edge 1990; Schaller 1977). Fecundity is high, twinning being frequent and triplets have been observed all over the range (Gunoglu and Ogurlu 2009, Magomedov <em>et al.</em> 2014, Roberts 1977, Weinberg and Malkhasyan 2011). Post-parturition period kid/female index varies from 0.46 in Pakistan (Edge and Olson-Edge 1990) to 0.5 in Turkmenistan (Korshunov 1994), to 1.0 in Armenia (Weinberg and Malkhasyan 2011) and to 1.26 in one year in Daghestan (Magomedov <em>et al. </em>2014). Yearlings make 9.8% to17.1% during the rut in different areas in Armenia (Weinberg and Malkhasyan 2011), and 16-18% in Daghestan (Magomedov <em>et al.</em> 2014), but probably the lower figure is more typical to the rest of the species range.<br/><br/>Wild goat is a principal prey for leopard <em>Panthera pardus</em> in Iran (Farhadinia <em>et al</em>. 2018) but also an important prey for Cheetah <em>Acinonyx jubatus</em> in central Iran (Farhadinia and Hemami 2010), while wolf <em>Canis lupus</em> rarely hunts wild goat in Iran (Hosseini-Zavarei <em>et al.</em> 2013). In the Greater Caucasus, impact of predators upon wild goat is generally considered non-significant (Magomadov <em>et al.</em> 2014, Weinberg 1999), though Eurasian lynx <em>Lynx lynx</em>, wolf and even brown bear <em>Ursus arctos</em> can catch, at least, juveniles (Weinberg, 2013) and golden eagles <em>Aquila chrysaetos</em> scan cliffs intermittently in summer and try to hunt kids (Weinberg 1999). Mortality caused by snow avalanches has not been recorded, even in the Greater Caucasus, unlike tur <em>Capra caucasica</em> and <em>Capra cylindricornis</em>&#160; (Magomedov <em>et al</em>. 2014). In Daghestan in the North Greater Caucasus, females may live up to 18 years but usually less, while males can reach the age of 14 (Magomedov <em>et al</em>. 2014). In Turkmenistan, males live up to 11 years (Korshunov 1994). Mortality among juveniles varies from 40% to 75% in different areas and years in Armenia (Weinberg and Malkhasyan 2011). In Daghestan, this index is about 35%, while among adults it is about 3-6%, higher in males (Magomedov <em>et al</em>. 2014).<br/><br/>In the Greater Caucasus in Daghestan and Chechnya, wild goat is sympatric with the Eastern tur <em>Capra cylindricornis</em> that dominates above timberline but may be less numerous than wild goat in the forest (Weinberg 1999). In Chechnya, wild goat is sympatric, but much less numerous, with Caucasian chamois <em>Rupicapra r. caucasica</em>, particularly on the limestone Rocky Range (Lukarevsky 2018). However, main wild goat distribution on the northern slope of the Eastern Greater Caucasus is on the Side Range, where chamois is very rare (Weinberg 1999). Where wild goat does occur on the north slope of the Main Range, it is a forest dweller as usual in the Greater Caucasus, while chamois mostly stays above timberline (Babaev <em>et al</em>. 2016). Roe deer <em>Capreolus capreolus</em> also shares habitat with the wild goat, not only in the Greater Caucasus (Weinberg 1999), but also in several locations in South-East Armenia (Weinberg, 2011). In the Caucasus Minor and the rest of the vast range, it often is sympatric with various wild sheep: mouflon <em>Ovis gmelini, </em>urial <em>Ovis vignei</em> etc. (sheep preferring less precipitous terrain). Thus, though being sympatric with several other ungulate species, wild goat is usually ecologically more or less separated from them.</p>',

The nominate subspecies breeds from southeastern Alaska and southern Canada to Mexico. It is seen year-round in the southern half of its breeding range; the subspecies C. v. ternominatus is probably resident in the West Indies, and C. v. peruvianus inhabits Peru and areas of the surrounding countries throughout the year.

This genus contains around 185 species that are located in the southern United States, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean, with 16 different species endemic to Puerto Rico. The red-eyed coqui was not brought into Panama City from its native habitats until the late 1960s. There it became established in urban parks before it began to colonize outside the city in the 1980s. In Puerto Rico, the largest island inhabited by the red-eyed coqui, it is found up to 1,200 meters above sea level. It is often compared to the common coqui, Puerto Rico's unofficial territorial symbol, but upon a closer ecological look, the red-eyed coqui has many differences.",

This unique species of tropical frogs dwells primarily in crevices and grottos in the Cuchilla de Panduras mountain range in southeastern Puerto Rico. The native name guajón is derived from its habitat, guajonales, which are caves formed by rock formations between huge stones. Despite being the state animal and considered emblematic of the region, of the 17 species of coquí, three are believed to be extinct and the rest are rare and declining in numbers. The Puerto Rican rock frog is extremely restricted in geographical distribution. The frog is threatened due to deforestation, agricultural, rural, and industrial development, and the associated infrastructure. It is sometimes called the “demon of Puerto Rico" because of its eerie call and phantom-like appearance. The species was first described by American herpetologist, Chapman Grant in 1932.',

The habitat at the type locality occupies ca 180 ha; the species was not found in other wetland sites in the northern coastal plain. Individuals are active between 19:00-22:00 hours, while perching, sitting, or calling on herbaceous vegetation, between 0.4 m and 1.2 m above water level. Calling sites for males were found to be between 0.6 and 1.2 m above ground level. Egg clutches vary between 1-5 eggs and are mostly deposited on leaf axils of <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">S. lancifolia</span>. Embryos hatch after approximately 19 days (Rios-López and Thomas 2007; N. Rios-López pers. comm. 2008).<br/><br/>This species is thought to have year-round reproduction given the frequency of juveniles found in any given month. However, most adult activity (including calling males) is greater during the warm and wet months (May to November), and diminishes during the cooler and drier months (particularly between the end of January and end of March). It is expected that recruitment rates reflect this seasonal pattern with a greater amount of clutches being produced during the warm and wet months. The seasonal breeding pattern in this frog is similar to that of other species of the genus in Puerto Rico, such as <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">E. antillensis</span>, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">E. cochranae</span>,<span style=\"font-style: italic;\"> E. coqui</span>, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">E. cooki</span>, <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">E. gryllus</span> and <span style=\"font-style: italic;\">E. portoricensis</span>.

Humans began domesticating horses around 4000 BC, and their domestication is believed to have been widespread by 3000 BC. Specifically, horses in the subspecies caballus are domesticated, although some domesticated populations live in the wild as feral horses. However, these feral populations are not true wild horses, as this term is used to describe horses that have never been domesticated. There is an extensive, specialized vocabulary used to describe equine-related concepts, covering everything from anatomy to life stages, size, colors, markings, breeds, locomotion, and behavior.',

        description: '<strong>Behaviour </strong>This species is predominantly sedentary or locally dispersive, but makes partially or fully migratory movements in the northern parts of its range due to its vulnerability to freezing conditions (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). Most northern populations move south from September to December, returning again from March to May (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). The species breeds in solitary territorial pairs during the spring, especially during wet months (the exact timing varying geographically) (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). It remains largely solitary throughout the year although juveniles and adults may form diurnal feeding groups of up to 30 individuals in the winter, especially during hard weather (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), often congregating on sheltered lakes and ponds (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). <strong><br/><br/>Habitat </strong>The species inhabits freshwater wetlands, both still and moving, requiring easy access to open water (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996) and showing a preference for waters sheltered by woodland, bushes or tall emergent vegetation (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998). Suitable habitats include slow-flowing rivers (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998), oxbow lakes (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), streams, canals, ditches, lakes, reservoirs, sites with small open water surfaces such as pools and ponds only a few metres across, swamps, marshes (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998), seasonally flooded sites (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996) such as flood-plains (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), disused gravel pits, rice-fields (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998), sewage ponds (Taylor and van Perlo 1998), and occasionally mangroves (Puerto Rico)<strong></strong>. It generally avoids very open sites (especially those exposed to wind or wave action) (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998) and oligotrophic or saline habitats (although it may be found on brackish waters) (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996, Taylor and van Perlo 1998). When foraging the species may range onto drier grassland, agricultural land or meadows, and on migration and in the winter months it can often be observed on damp grassland away from water (Taylor and van Perlo 1998). <strong><br/><br/>Diet </strong>The species is omnivorous and opportunistic, its diet consisting of earthworms, crustaceans, molluscs, adult and larval insects (especially flies, mayflies, caddisflies, bugs, beetles and Lepidoptera), spiders, small fish, tadpoles and occasionally birds eggs, as well as plant matter such as filamentous algae, moss, the vegetative parts of reeds and aquatic plants, the seeds of reeds, rushes, sedges, water-lilies, waterside herbaceous vegetation, trees (<em>Ulmus</em> spp.) and cereal crops, flowers of <em>Eichhornia</em> spp., and the berries and fruits of yew, <em>Rubus</em>, <em>Sorbus</em>, <em>Rosa</em>, <em>Crataegus</em>, <em>Rhamnus</em>, <em>Hedera</em>, <em>Sambucus</em>, <em>Hippophae</em> spp. and various orchard trees (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). <strong><br/><br/>Breeding site </strong>The nest varies between a shallow saucer and a deep cup constructed from twigs and waterside vegetation, and can be floating on or positioned up to 1 m above water in emergent vegetation, or positioned on a solid platform of branches in water. Less often the nest is placed in ground vegetation or in low bushes on the bank near water, or in bushes and trees up to 8 m from the ground (del Hoyo <em>et al</em>. 1996). <strong><br/><br/>Management information </strong>Early harvesting in rice-fields should be avoided as it harms nests and young broods of this species (Taylor and van Perlo 1998).',

These tree frogs can vary in size from 2 to 5.5 inches in length. Due to their large size, Cuban tree frogs can eat a wide variety of things, particularly native tree frogs, and their removal has shown to result in an increase in the amount of native tree frogs in an area.

        description: 'This species is often associated with man, living around buildings from  isolated farms to urban centres and showing a preference for suburbs. In  the south of its range it is more frequently found in open country, and  has been recorded as breeding in small isolated colonies away from  humans. In Central Asia and Afghanistan, the species is mainly a summer visitor, where it is confined to open country in the area of overlap with resident <em>P. montanus</em>; farther north, in Siberia, the two species live side by  side in built-up areas. It breeds from February to September, although timing varies  with latitude. It breeds in loose colonies and nests are constructed  mainly of plant stems, lined with feathers or other soft material. Its  preferred site is a hole in a building, cliff or tree. Clutches are two  to five eggs. The diet is mainly vegetable material, particularly seeds  of grasses, cultivated cereals and low herbs, but also buds, berries and  wide range of household scraps. It does take some animal matter (c. 10%  of the diet in summer months). The species is mostly resident with some limited withdrawal of populations breeding at high latitudes and altitudes to less cold areas in winter  (Summers-Smith <em>et al</em>. 2015).',

It is a small bird that has a typical length of 16 cm (6.3 in) and a mass of 24–39.5 g (0.85–1.39 oz). Females and young birds are coloured pale brown and grey, and males have brighter black, white, and brown markings. One of about 25 species in the genus Passer, the house sparrow is native to most of Europe, the Mediterranean Basin, and a large part of Asia. Its intentional or accidental introductions to many regions, including parts of Australasia, Africa, and the Americas, make it the most widely distributed wild bird.',

        description: '<strong>Behaviour</strong> This species is fully migratory (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). It departs its breeding grounds from late-July to September (southward movements continuing into November) and returns from late-May to June (Hayman <em>et al.</em> 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). It breeds from May to August in solitary well-dispersed pairs and forages alone or in small loose flocks of up to 30 individuals (Johnsgard 1981, Hayman <em>et al.</em> 1986, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). It is gregarious during the winter however, often roosting in large flocks containing up to several thousand individuals (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> The species nests in the high Arctic in both upland and valley locations between the treeline and the coast, utilising dry stony tundra with sedge, moss, lichen, grass or dwarf birch, peat ridges in tundra marshes, dry exposed ridges, riverbanks, raised sand or gravel beaches, and rocky slopes (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998). <em>Non-breeding</em> Outside of the breeding season the species frequents intertidal mudflats, saltmarshes, sandflats and beaches of oceanic coastlines, bays and estuaries (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). During migration it may also be found inland on lakes, pools or grasslands (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Diet</strong> <em>Breeding</em> During the breeding season the diet of this species consists largely of adult and larval insects such as beetles and Diptera as well as some plant matter (e.g. grass seeds and stems) (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <em>Non-breeding</em> When on the coast in its wintering range the species takes marine polychaete worms, molluscs and crustaceans (e.g. crabs, sand shrimps), occasionally also taking insects (e.g. grasshoppers and beetles) or earthworms when in inland habitats on passage (Johnsgard 1981, del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a shallow scrape on dry ground in exposed, stony sites, neighbouring nests not less than 400 m apart (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996, Snow and Perrins 1998).&#160;<br/><br/><strong>Management information</strong> In the UK there is evidence that the removal of Common Cordgrass (<em>Spartina anglica</em>) from tidal mudflats using a herbicide is beneficial for the species (Evans 1986).',

        description: 'A nocturnal and terrestrial toad that inhabits humid areas with adequate cover, including cane fields, savannah, open forest, well watered yards and gardens. It also inhabits dry equatorial forests. It thrives in degraded habitats and man-made environments, and is occasionally found in pristine lowland and montane rainforests, but generally prefers open or disturbed habitat such as tracks, roads, low grassland and areas that are near human settlement, e.g. grazing land, suburban parks and gardens. It tends to avoid more densely vegetated areas (eg. wet sclerophyll and rainforest), which can then act as a barrier to their dispersal. It can be found by day beneath fallen trees, loose boards, matted coconut leaves, and similar cover (Lynn 1940). It feeds on arthropods (especially ants and termites) and small vertebrates. It is flexible regards breeding site (Evans <em>et al.</em> 1996); eggs and larvae develop in slow or still shallow waters of ponds, ditches, temporary pools, reservoirs, canals, and streams. Clutch size is between 8,000 and 17,000. Eggs and tadpoles are poisonous and displace native tadpoles. It may sometimes breed in slightly brackish water in Hawaii. Larvae are tolerant of high temperatures.',

The species may also nest singly amidst colonies of other tern species (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). It usually feeds singly or in small flocks and roosts gregariously even outside of the breeding season (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).&#160;<strong><br/></strong><strong>Habitat</strong> <em>Breeding</em> For breeding the species shows a preference for inaccessible sites including barren sandy beaches, islands in saltmarsh, dredge spoil and coral islands surrounded by shallow water and with a high degree of visibility, no mammalian predators and little vegetation (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). It also forages along estuaries, in lagoons and in mangroves during this season, mostly within 100 m of the shore but up to 40 km from the breeding colony (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <em>Non-breeding</em> Outside of the breeding season the species forages within 100 m of the land along sheltered coasts in estuaries, harbours and river mouths, sometimes also foraging a short distance inland along broad rivers (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996). <strong>Diet</strong> Its diet consists predominantly of small fish 3-18 cm long as well as squid, shrimps and crabs (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).&#160;<strong>Breeding site</strong> The nest is a simple scrape (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996) in sand (Urban <em>et al.</em> 1986) in inaccessible sites surrounded by shallow water near the mouths of bays with a high degree of visibility, no mammalian predators and little vegetation (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).&#160;<strong>Management information</strong> The preferred breeding sites of this species are often vulnerable to flooding (del Hoyo <em>et al.</em> 1996).',

        description: 'The white-winged dove is a dove whose native range extends from the Southwestern United States through Mexico, Central America, and the Caribbean. They are large for doves, and can be distinguished from similar doves by the distinctive white edge on their wings. They have a blue eyering, and red eyes. The plumage is brownish-gray to gray. Juveniles are duller in color, and have brown eyes. The call is likened to English phrase "who cooks for you". There are three subspecies. It was first described by George Edwards in 1743, and given its binomial name by Linnaeus in 1756. It was moved into the genus Zenaida in 1838.',
