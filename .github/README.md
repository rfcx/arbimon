## Future Ideas

### Issue Templates vs Issue Forms

[Issue Forms](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository#creating-issue-forms) are a new future coming to GitHub that allows us to create a proper form with input controls. However, they are currently only available in beta for public repositories -- we may adopt them in the future.
